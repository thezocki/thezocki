# **Hi, I'm Alex!**

### **Introduction**
I'm a passionate developer who **likes building cool things** with **C++**, **Java** and **Go**. I'm particularly skilled in **programming videogames** (clientside and serverside), using Unreal Engine and my own Game Engine (Horizon Engine).

I have also worked for several **large Minecraft servers and content creators**, where I created **games and events** that were enjoyed by **thousands of people**.

> Currently working on a personal Game Engine, with expectations of making it open-source in the near future.
